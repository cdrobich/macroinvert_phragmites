## Aquatic
- `benthic_invertebrates_univariate.csv` - univariate measures from the submerged vegetation samples
- `benthic_inverts_relativized.csv` - community composition matrix relativized by column max

## Emerging 
- `emerging_invertebrate_univariate.csv` - univariate measures from the submerged vegetation samples
- `emerging_2018.csv` - site characteristics (vegetation community composition, water temp/depth, and canopy height) and macroinvertebrate community composition matrix relativized by column max

## Procrustes
- `aquatic_procrustes.csv` - community matrix for aquatic invertebrates with an adult flying stage
- `emerging_procrustes.csv` - community matrix for emerging invertebrates with a juvenile aquatic stage
