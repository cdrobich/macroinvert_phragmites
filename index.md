### Control of invasive *Phragmites australis* (European common reed) alters macroinvertebrate communities

The removal of an established invasive species can have significant effects on native communities. We examined how macroinvertebrates communities responded to the glyphosate-based herbicide removal of invasive *Phragmites australis* ([European common reed](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2012/08/11/phragmites_australis_is_canadas_worst_invasive_plant.html)) in a Lake Erie coastal marsh ([Long Point, ON](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/longpoint/).

### Article Abstract

> Wetland restoration often involves invasive-plant suppression to encourage the recovery of native-dominated vegetation com-munities. However, assessment of recovery is usually focused only on vegetation, and the response of other critical wetlandbiota, such as macroinvertebrates, is seldom assessed. We characterized the aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial macroinvertebrate communities in remnant, uninvaded marsh to identify restoration targets and compared this to the communities inPhragmites australis-invaded marsh and in the formerly invaded marsh that was treated with the herbicide glyphosate in 2016 to simultaneously evaluate the effects of invasion and invasive-species suppression. We sampled invertebrates in 2017 and 2018 to track 2 years following herbicide treatment. The invertebrate community composition was similar between *P. australis* invaded and remnant marsh, suggesting invasion has little effect on macroinvertebrate community structure. Therewas also high concordance between the aquatic and emerging-invertebrate communities in the invaded and uninvaded habi-tats. In contrast, herbicide-treated sites had a unique community composition, characterized by very high densities of Chironomidae (Diptera) and low taxa richness and evenness. Herbicide-treated sites also exhibited low concordance between theaquatic and emerging-invertebrate communities, potentially attributable to the sparse, emergent-vegetation cover providinglimited substrates for emergence. Herbicide-based, invasive-species control resulted in considerable changes to the macroinver-tebrate community in freshwater marshes for at least 2 years after treatment, which may have consequences for aquatic foodwebs and species that rely on macroinvertebrates as prey.
